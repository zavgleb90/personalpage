          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems in the College of Business at Auburn University at
            Montgomery (AUM). My research lies at the intersection of data analytics, machine learning and artificial
            intelligence, operations research, and the science of science. I study how information technologies and
            advanced analytics improve decision-making in business and healthcare, and how research productivity and
            institutional performance evolve across disciplines and journals.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work has appeared in <em>Decision Support Systems</em> and <em>Production and Operations Management</em>,
            and I have ongoing projects spanning healthcare IT, knowledge management and creativity, and bibliometric
            analyses of leading business and IS journals.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            Across my research streams, my goal is to combine methodological innovation with practical impact—advancing
            knowledge while generating insights that inform business practice, healthcare decision-making, and the
            development of research institutions.
          </p>

          <h3>Research Overview</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Healthcare IT &amp; decision models:</strong> predictive and prescriptive analytics to support
              high-stakes clinical decisions (e.g., Bayesian optimal stopping with dynamic patient trajectories).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Knowledge management, IT capability &amp; creativity:</strong> how codification vs. personalization
              KM strategy, communication channels, and IT capability jointly shape team creativity (multilevel evidence).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Science of science &amp; research productivity:</strong> patterns in author, journal, discipline,
              and institutional performance across large-scale datasets (FT50 / UTD24 and related bibliometrics).

        <section id="teaching" class="card">
          <h2>Teaching</h2>
          <p>
            My teaching interests include Business Analytics (data analytics, statistical data mining), business
            programming (R/Python), and AI/ML for business applications (deep learning, NLP, and applied AI).
          </p>

          <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            I aim to create a learner-centered environment that combines challenging content with applied activities.
            I regularly use semester-long projects broken into modules and in-class assignments that help students
            connect concepts to practice. I also work intentionally to establish a safe learning environment where
            questions are welcomed and mistakes are treated as opportunities for growth.
          </p>
